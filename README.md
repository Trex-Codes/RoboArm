# RoboArm

Prototype of a robot with a robotic arm, implemented using two Arduinos Uno. The first manages the movement system, while the second controls the arm system, which consists of
5 axes that allow movement thanks to servos. Additionally, it features a series of potentiometers that regulate the degrees of freedom for each axis. These two sections 
are separated by the use of exclusive Arduino shields and a 4-wheel chassis with its respective DC motors.

### Requirements

* Arduino Uno (2)
* shield motor v1 driver l293d
* Sensor Shield v5
* potentiometer (6)
* 18650 Battery Holder Case Box (Single, dual)
* Robotic arm (6 Servos Sg90)
* Board Bluetooth 2.0 Ref HC0
* 4WD Car Robot chassis Kit
* 3V - 6V Gearbox DC Motor
